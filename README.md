### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a graduate computer science student at the University of southern California. My research interests include **Deep Learning** and **Generative AI**. <br>
In particular, I'm interested in working on the problem of extracting reach representing features using **Generative Models** and other methods and I believe this direction of research is going to help AI take one step further towards Artificial General Intelligence. I mostly enjoy applying Deep Learning to Computer Vision problems; However I try not to limit myself as long as I can be effective.<br>
I am also fascinated by **Medical Applications of Machine Learning** and how it can assist or even outperform human experts in many cases. I believe A.I can make our lives a lot easier and more enjoyable and A.I researchers are the ones who can help make that a reality. I intend to do just that.
